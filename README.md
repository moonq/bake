# bake

Bash make, with very lightweight approach

This is very similar to https://github.com/rumkin/bake project, but 
slightly simpler implementation. No additional folders or files, 
just a Bakefile with functions required.

If you want to use the interactive menu, install https://github.com/p-gen/smenu 
`smenu` is installable via apt-get in debian/ubuntu based distros.
